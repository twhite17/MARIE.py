# MARIE.py
A simple Assembler and Emulator for MARIE

Why did I make this?
  
  Two Reasons
  
  1.  Because during the FIT1047 assignment at monash I was frustrated being stuck with a web editor. Plus the 
      actual text editor only makes a small portion of the website making it harder and harder to see the 
      full perspective of my code as my project got more complicated.
  
  2. Because I thought this would be a fun learning exercise
  
DISCLAIMER:

I am not in any way associated with the developers of MARIE.js and I am certainly not an expert when it comes to writing compilers and/or understanding hardware architectures.

I will not take any legal or other responsibility for ANY issues with this software. If you decide to use this for your assignment or anything else of importance then you do so at your own risk. Make sure you regularly back up your work and every so often you should check your assignment still works with MARIE.js (that is what you'll be assessed with after all)

All that being said, please feel free to report bugs though.  ;)

TLDR:
  Don't be stupid, make sure your assignment works in MARIE.js before submission. Use this software at your own risk.
