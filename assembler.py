"""
A Simple MARIE assembler in python 3

Why does this project exist?
	I developed this assembler (alongside an emulator) because I found it
	frustrating having to do my FIT1047 assignment in the tiny web editor
	that was provided to me. With these two tools you will be able to use
	your own editor of choice and just compile and run your code when you 
	want to test it.
